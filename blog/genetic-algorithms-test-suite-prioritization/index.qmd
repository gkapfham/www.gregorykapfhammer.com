## Introduction

Ever wondered how to optimize the order of your test suite for so that it
quickly covers parts of your program under test? In a recent research paper I
wrote [@Conrad2010a] [{{< iconify fa6-solid
book-open>}}](/research/papers/conrad2010a/index.qmd), my co-authors and I
experimentally investigate how genetic algorithms can best support test suite
prioritizers that re-order the tests to cover code quickly. This paper presents
a comprehensive genetic algorithm-based prioritization technique that employs a
wide variety of mutation, crossover, and selection operators. Intrigued? Keep
reading for a brief overview!

## Research

Our research introduces a genetic algorithm-based prioritizer that features six
mutation operators, seven approaches to crossover, and three methods for
performing selection. Using the coverage effectiveness (CE) metric as a fitness
function, the prioritization method incorporates both the execution time and
requirement coverage of each test to evolve a test suite that rapidly covers the
test requirements. 

## Findings

The empirical study reveals the unique role that the selection operator plays in
constructing an effective ordering of a test suite. The results suggest that
high selection intensity and selection elitism are both important for producing
good test suite orderings. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm consistently
produces results that are better than random search, suggesting that it may
serve as the foundation for a powerful approach to test suite prioritization.

## Future

Our research opens up new avenues for future work. We intend to further
investigate ways to improve the performance of the genetic algorithm, such as
reducing fitness calculation time or implementing parallel genetic algorithms
that reorder test suites. Interested in learning more about the power of genetic
algorithms in test suite prioritization? Make sure to read [@Conrad2010a] [{{< iconify

information about the technique that we implemented and the approach that we
took to evaluate its effectiveness.
