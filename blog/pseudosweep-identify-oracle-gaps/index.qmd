## Introduction

Are your tests as effective as you think they are? While statement coverage is
a common metric for test suite quality, it often doesn't tell the whole story.
High coverage scores can create a false sense of security, leaving critical
gaps in your testing strategy. In the paper [@Maton2025] [{{< iconify
fa6-solid book-open>}}](/research/papers/maton2025/index.qmd), my colleagues
and I investigate how to identify an "oracle gap" that comprises the code that
is executed by test suite but not actually checked by any assertions. A key
contribution of this paper is a tool called `GapGrep` that uses three distinct
methods to helps researchers and practitioners identify these oracle gaps in
their test suites. Interested in learning more about this paper? Keep reading!

## Key Contributions

This research provides a comprehensive empirical comparison of three different
Oracle Gap Calculation Approaches (OGCAs) and the gaps that they produce:

* **Checked Coverage using a Dynamic Slicer (CCDS)**: This technique uses
dynamic slicing to identify statements that influence the outcome of a test
assertion.
* **Checked Coverage using an Observational Slicer (CCOS)**: This approach
repeatedly deletes lines of code to see if the program's behavior changes.
* **Pseudo-Tested Statement Identification (PTSI)**: This method identifies
the pseudo-tested statements that can be removed without causing any test to
fail.

This paper's study offers a quantitative and qualitative analysis of these
techniques, helping developers choose the most suitable approach for their
needs.

## Empirical Results

We conducted an empirical study on 30 Java classes from six open-source
projects, and our findings were clear:

* **PTSI is the most efficient and effective OGCA**: This method consistently
identified the oracle gaps with the lowest mutation scores, indicating that it
is the best at pinpointing areas where fault detection is weak.
* **PTSI is the fastest approach**: Using pseudo-testedness to identify
program statements in the oracle gap has good performance, making it a
practical choice for developers who need to quickly assess their test suites.
* **Distinct oracle gaps**: identified by the three OGCAs were largely
distinct, suggesting that they uncover different types of testing weaknesses.

## Future

While our study focused on programs implemented in Java, the concept of oracle
gaps is applicable to a wide range of programming languages. Future work will
involve expanding our analysis to other languages and exploring how these
techniques can be integrated into the software development lifecycle to provide
developers with real-time feedback on their tests.
