## Introduction

Prior research and development experiences have proven the Alternating Variable
Method (AVM) to be a fast and effective local search technique for search-based
software engineering. Moreover, recent improvements to the AVM have generalized
the representations it can optimize and have provably reduced its running time.
Yet, until recently, there has been no general, publicly-available
implementation of the AVM that incorporates these features.

I am pleased to report that [@McMinn2016b] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open >}}](/research/papers/mcminn2016b/index.qmd)
introduced AVMf, an object-oriented
framework that provides an implementation of the AVM in the Java programming
language. AVMf is available from the <a
  href="https://github.com/AVMf/avmf">AVMf/avmf</a> GitHub repository for your
use!

## Launch Pad

My hope is that AVMf can serve as a "launch pad" for new research and
development in search-based software engineering (SBSE). So, do you have a new
search-based method but are dreading the creation of a bespoke system? Are you
interested in learning how to use an AVM? Or, do you have an idea for a new
SBSE example that we should integrate into the tool? If yes, then please try
AVMf and [contact](/contact/index.qmd) me to share your ideas!
