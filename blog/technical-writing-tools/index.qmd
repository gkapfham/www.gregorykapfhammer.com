## Introduction

If you are like me, then you may enjoy writing in a notebook with a fountain pen
&mdash; if you have not tried writing this way, then borrow someone's fountain
pen and try it. As much as I may like taking notes and brainstorming with a
fountain pen, I spend a substantial amount of time preparing technical
[papers](/research/papers/index.qmd) and
[presentations](/research/presentations/index.qmd) in
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) with the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) text
editor &mdash; a task I also find to be challenging and rewarding. Thankfully,
some tools can aid your writing process!

## Tools

If you write with Vim and LaTeX and you would like to improve your writing
experience, then please consider using the
[vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) plugin as it supports wonderful
features like the completion of BibTeX references, continuous compilation with
[latexmk](http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/), and forward
and reverse searching for either the
[Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) or [MuPDF](http://mupdf.com/) PDF
viewers. Are you interested in learning more about how I configured these
plugins? Please study the source code of my `.vimrc` that is available in the
GitHub repository called [gkapfham/dotfiles](https://github.com/gkapfham/dotfiles).

## Examples

Yes, it is possible to use these tools to create nicely formatted and correct
papers. As an example of a paper, please consider reading [@McMinn2016a] [{{<
iconify fa6-solid book-open >}}](/research/papers/mcminn2016a/index.qmd), the source code of which
is also in a GitHub repository at <a
  href="https://github.com/gkapfham/ast2016-paper">gkapfham/ast2016-paper</a>.
An example of a presentation that my collaborators and I prepared in LaTeX is for the paper [@Kinneer2015] [{{<
iconify fa6-solid book-open >}}](/research/papers/kinneer2015/index.qmd), which
is available in the GitHub repository <a
  href="https://github.com/gkapfham/seke2015-presentation">gkapfham/seke2015-presentation</a>.
There's something else that is really nice about making your papers and
presentations in LaTeX &mdash; you can release their source code on GitHub to
share with others an "instruction manual" that explains, in a step-by-step
fashion, exactly how to produce a document like yours!

## Status Update

Since this blog post was written, I continue to use LaTeX to prepare research
articles. However, I now use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) instead of Vim! With
that said, you can still check out the configuration files in
[gkapfham/dotfiles](https://github.com/gkapfham/dotfiles) to learn more about my
current setup. Finally, instead of using LaTeX to create presentations, I now
normally use Neovim to create Markdown, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files.
