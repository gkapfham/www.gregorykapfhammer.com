## Important Context

This post was written to support my participation in a panel at the
<em>27th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge
Engineering</em>. To view the accompanying slides for this presentation, please
refer to [@Kapfhammer2015a] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open

If you want to learn more about new work that my colleagues and students and I
are conducting in the area of efficiently testing data-centric applications,
then please read [@Kinneer2015] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open

that were also presented at the same conference.

## Introduction

Big data analytics software allows researchers and practitioners to create
descriptive models and make predictions. Often characterized
by the "three Vs" of volume, velocity, and variety, big data systems must
respectively handle large amounts of data that arrive rapidly and take many
different forms. In fields such as evidence-based medicine and the
detection of financial fraud, big data software is poised to and, indeed
already is, making important contributions.

## Challenge

However, there is an additional "V" that is often overlooked
by both researchers and practitioners: veracity. That is, if there is a
lack of correctness in the software and data that makes up a big data analytics
system, then the data models and the resulting predictions may be compromised
&mdash; with serious consequences. For instance, the Data Warehouse Institute
reports that North American organizations experience a $611 billion annual loss
due to poor data quality. Scott W. Ambler argues that the
"virtual absence" of software and data testing is the primary cause of this
loss. Although this example is not specifically tied to big data
systems, it clearly illustrates the risks associated with a lack of veracity in
any data-rich field.

The challenge for software testing researchers is to develop and empirically
evaluate new methods that can accommodate the volume, velocity, and variety
that is characteristic of big data systems.  While some preliminary work (e.g.,
the testing of both data mining systems and database applications) has recently
been published, few software engineering researchers have focused on big data
testing. Since veracity is not always considered by big data researchers, the
challenge for these individuals is to create and assess new techniques that,
whenever possible, holistically consider all of the "four Vs". If not already
doing so, practitioners in both of these fields should start to establish a
confidence in the correctness of both their software and data through the
disciplined use of testing.

## Position

The title of my position statement poses the question "is big data a big deal?"
Of course, the answer to this question is "yes". With that said, the increase
of big data's importance and impact will be accelerated and even sustained if
researchers and practitioners in fields such as software engineering, software
testing, and big data collaborate with each other to develop efficient and
effective data analytics systems that construct high-quality models and make
accurate predictions. Let's collaborate across the fields of
software engineering and big data to ensure that we have a positive influence
on society &mdash; thus proving to be a "bigger deal" together than we would
have been on our own.

## Further Details

Interested in learning more about this topic? Since this blog post was first
written, my colleagues and students and I have published several additional
papers about the testing of relational database schemas, with the most
noteworthy one being [@McMinn2015] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open
>}}](/research/papers/mcminn2015/index.qmd).
If you are interested in using SchemaAnalyst to test your own database schema,
then please download and use the tool, which is now available from the GitHub
site <a
