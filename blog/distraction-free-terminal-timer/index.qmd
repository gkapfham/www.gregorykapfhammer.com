## Introduction

Have you ever struggled to focus on your technical writing? Even though I enjoy
writing [research](/research/) papers, I too can sometimes find it difficult to
focus on technical writing. So, what should you do when you mind is wandering
and you have to finish some content by a deadline? Of course, set a timer!

Since I write [papers](/research/papers/) and
[presentations](/research/presentations/) using Neovim in a terminal window
running `tmux`, I recently looked for a timer that I could also run at the
command prompt. Thankfully, I discovered this
[post](http://www.slashgeek.net/2016/10/25/termdown-cli-countdown-timer-stopwatch/)
about [termdown](https://github.com/trehn/termdown)! If you check the
documentation for `termdown`, you will notice that it is a Python program that
you install by typing the following command in your terminal window: `pip
install termdown`. This program has a lot of options that you can learn more
about by reading its documentation. For my purposes, I wanted the countdown
timer to run for 30 minutes and then to trigger an Ubuntu notification when it
expired.

## Command

It is possible to achieve this goal with a single command in your terminal!

```
termdown 30m -T "Distraction-Free Writing" --no-figlet && notify-send "Distraction-Free Writing" \ "Task Finished\!"
```

The first parameter specifies the number of minutes for which I will be writing
and the second gives a title to the countdown display. Using the `--no-figlet`
parameter ensures that `termdown` shows a minimal countdown timer. Finally, when
the timer completes, the call to `notify-send` will trigger an Ubuntu
notification with "Distraction-Free Writing" as the title and "Task Finished!"
as the message. This should also work with other Linux operating systems.

## Further Details

Do you have any questions about this technique? Or, do you have some tips for
distraction-free writing? If you do, then I hope that you will
[contact](/contact/) me soon!
