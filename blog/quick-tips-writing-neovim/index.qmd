## Introduction

I enjoy using Vim when I am writing LaTeX documents for my
[teaching](/teaching/index.qmd) and [research](/research/index.qmd). Since
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) became available I have been using it as a capable
and compelling alternative to Vim. I find that Neovim works really well and that
its plugin ecosystem is great! But, if you want the
[vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) plugin to work with Neovim, then you
need to take two steps, as explained in this post.

What do you need to do to write LaTeX in Neovim? When I was writing
@Walsh2017a] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open >}}](/research/papers/walsh2017a/index.qmd) with Neovim,
I needed to change my `.vimrc` file and install a plugin. After following the
instructions to install the <a
  href="https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote">neovim-remote</a> plugin, I
added this code segment to ensure that `vimtex` can communicate with the
`latexmk` process that compiles my paper.

```vim
if has("nvim")
  let g:vimtex_latexmk_progname = 'nvr'
endif
```

## Retrofit

Wait! There is one more thing. If you, like me, have been using Vim for many
years and only recently started to use Neovim, then you will also need to run
commands like the following so that you can "retrofit" your Vim configuration to
work correctly with Neovim. Or, you can re-write your Vim configuration in Lua,
which is what I ended up doing!

```vim
ln -s ~/.vim ~/.nvim
ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.nvim/init.vim
```

## Stay Connected

Are you interested in learning more about how I configure Vim and Neovim? Please
study the source code of my `.vimrc` that is available in the GitHub repository
[gkapfham/dotfiles](https://github.com/gkapfham/dotfiles). With that said, since
this post was written I've converted my Neovim configuration to use Lua and the
[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager. This means that
you should study my `init.lua` file instead!
