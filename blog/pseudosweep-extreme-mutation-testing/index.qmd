## Introduction

Ever wondered if your test suite is truly good at finding bugs? What if there
are hidden weaknesses that traditional testing methods miss? 
In the paper [@Maton2024] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open >}}](/research/papers/Maton2024/index.qmd),
my colleagues and I explore how eXtreme mutation testing (XMT) can uncover these
hidden weaknesses in your test suite. By identifying pseudo-tested methods ---
or those methods in your program that appear to be tested even though they are
not --- XMT can help you improve your test suite's effectiveness and ensure more
robust software. Let's dive into how these XMT works and why it may be a
game-changer for software testing!

## The Basics of Extreme Mutation Testing

Extreme mutation testing (XMT) is a technique that detects deficiencies in a
test suite by deleting method bodies in covered code and observing whether the
test suite detects their absence. If a method deletion goes unnoticed, the
method is labeled as "pseudo-tested." This means the method is executed by the
test suite but its result isn't checked by any assertions, indicating a
potential blind spot in your tests.

## Pseudo-Tested Methods: The Hidden Weaknesses

Pseudo-tested methods are those that are executed during testing but aren't
effectively validated. This can lead to lower mutation scores and missed bugs.
Tools like Descartes and Reneri can identify these pseudo-tested methods without
the need for full mutation testing, providing quick feedback to developers.

## Key Insights from Our Research

Our research introduces the statement deletion mutation operator (SDL) to
uncover pseudo-tested statements within methods. We found that 48% of
pseudo-tested statements exist outside of pseudo-tested methods, meaning
traditional mutation testing would miss these deficiencies. By combining XMT
with SDL, we can pinpoint subtle yet important testing oversights.

## Empirical Results

In our study involving 27 Java projects, we discovered 722 pseudo-tested
statements. We also found that pseudo-tested statements achieved lower mutation
scores than required statements. This highlights the importance of using SDL to
detect these hidden weaknesses.

## Why This Matters

While our research focused on Java programs, the concepts of XMT and
pseudo-tested methods are broadly applicable. These techniques can be used in
various programming languages to improve test suite effectiveness and ensure
more robust software.

## Future Directions

We're excited about the potential of combining XMT with other testing techniques
to further enhance test suite robustness. Future work will involve extending our
approach to different programming languages and exploring additional categories
of flaky tests.
