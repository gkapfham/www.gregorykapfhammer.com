## Introduction

Ever wondered if your test suite is truly good at finding bugs? What if there
are hidden weaknesses that traditional testing methods miss? 
In the paper [@Maton2024] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open >}}](/research/papers/Maton2024/index.qmd),
my colleagues and I explore how eXtreme mutation testing (XMT) can uncover these
hidden weaknesses in your test suite. By identifying pseudo-tested methods ---
or those methods in your program that appear to be tested even though they are
not --- XMT can help you improve your test suite's effectiveness and ensure more
robust software. Let's dive into how these XMT works and why it may be a
game-changer for software testing!

## Understanding XMT

An XMT tool automatically detects deficiencies in a test suite by deleting
method bodies in covered code and observing whether the test suite detects their
absence. If a method deletion goes unnoticed, then the method is labeled as
"pseudo-tested," meaning that the test suite calls the method but its result
isn't checked by the assertions, indicating a potential testing blind spot. As
an extension to XMT, our paper explores the use of the statement deletion
mutation operator (SDL) to uncover pseudo-tested statements within methods.

## Research Insights

Using the `PseudoSweep` tool [@Maton2024a] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open >}}](/research/papers/Maton2024a/index.qmd) to perform mutation testing with the XMT and SDL operators
to four frequently-studied Apache Commons Java projects and 23 projects randomly
selected from the Maven Central Repository, this paper's experiments find 722
different cases of pseudo-tested statements. Interestingly, the paper's results
show that 48% of pseudo-tested statements exist outside of pseudo-tested
methods! This means that the detection of testing deficiencies related to these
statements would likely be left to traditional, yet resource-intensive, mutation
testing. Ultimately, this paper shows that XMT alone is insufficient and should
be combined with pseudo-tested statement evaluation to pinpoint subtle, yet
important, testing oversights that a developer should tackle before applying
traditional mutation testing.

## Future Directions

While our research focused on Java programs, the concepts of XMT and
pseudo-tested methods are broadly applicable. These techniques can be used in
various programming languages to improve test suite effectiveness and ensure
more robust software. We're excited about the potential of combining XMT with
other testing techniques to further enhance test suite robustness. Future work
will involve extending our approach to different programming languages and
exploring additional categories of flaky tests.

As we continue to explore how mutation testing can support the detection and
repair of pseudo-tested methods, your insights and suggestions are appreciated!
