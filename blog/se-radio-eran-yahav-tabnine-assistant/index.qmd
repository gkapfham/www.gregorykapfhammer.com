## Introduction

In a recent episode of the [Software Engineering
Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/) podcast, I interviewed [Eran
Yahav](https://csaws.cs.technion.ac.il/~yahave/), the CTO of Tabnine and a
faculty member in the Computer Science Department at the Israel Institute of
Technology. Our conversation focused on [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/),
an artificial intelligence (AI) coding assistant that uses large language models
(LLMs) to help software engineers with tasks like code completion, explanation,
and test case generation. In this podcast interview, Eran offers insights into
how Tabnine bridges the gap between powerful LLMs and practical software
engineering needs through enterprise context and trust.

## Insights

I'm thankful for this thought-provoking interview with Eran Yahav! Here are some
of its insights:

**How does Tabnine's enterprise context engine make AI assistants more effective?**

> From the LLM to an actual use of software engineer, there is a hole that has
> to happen in the middle, right? Part of that is the context that I mentioned
> earlier. So Tabnine has what we call the enterprise context engine, which is
> something that basically knows how to draw relevant context from all code
> sources of information and non-code sources of information in the
> organization to make sure that again, Tabnine operates like an onboarded
> employee of the organization and not as a foreign engineer in the org. So
> Tabnine knows everything about the org, and which informs the code that it
> generates, how it reviews code, etc.

**What is the vision for AI assistance across the software development lifecycle?**

> So the Tabnine provides assistance across the entire SDLC. It helps you write
> code with code completions that are very advanced. It has a chat interface
> that allows you to create new code, review code, refactor code, translate
> between languages, generate tests as you mentioned initially, document code,
> explain it. So it basically helps you do anything that you have to do as a
> software engineer and the vision is really to provide agents that help you do
> anything and everything a software engineer does just faster and with a
> higher quality.

**How should software engineers think about the future of AI in programming?**

> I think really the future is every engineer is really a team lead and that
> team lead is leading a team of AI engineers. They could be specialized in
> different domains, the AI engineers, they could have varying expertise, but I
> think every engineer would have to start thinking like an engineering manager
> in a sense, or at least like a team lead.

**What makes the difference between AI assistants and existing tools like ChatGPT?**

> You can think about the LM as a kind of an ignorant genius. It knows how to
> do many, many, many things, but not in in the relevant context in which I'm
> operating, right? And you can think about the best engineer in the
> organization as someone who really knows the nuts and bolts of how things
> operate, right? [...] So you want really to bridge these two things, make the
> LLM as aware of the org as your best engineer and this is how you get like to
> 10x productivity of the AI engineer, right? To onboard the AI to your
> organization.
