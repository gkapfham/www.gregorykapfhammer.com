## Introduction

Responsive web design is essential for modern web pages that
must look great on everything from a phone to a desktop
monitor. But testing responsive layouts is tricky. Tools like
ReDeCheck can automatically detect potential responsive layout
failures (RLFs) by analyzing the document object model (DOM),
but they often flag issues that are not actually visible to
humans --- such as two transparent elements whose bounding
boxes technically overlap but whose content does not interfere.
This means developers must manually sift through every report
to decide what is a real problem and what is just noise.

My colleagues and I built a tool called VERVE --- short for **V**isual
classifi**E**r for **R**esponsi**V**e t**E**sting --- that automates this
tedious classification process. In [@Althomali2021] [{{< iconify fa6-solid
book-open>}}](/research/papers/althomali2021/index.qmd), published in Journal of
Software Testing, Verification and Reliability, we show that VERVE can
automatically classify all five types of RLFs reported by ReDeCheck as true
positives, false positives, or non-observable issues. Across 469 potential
failures from 45 web pages, VERVE completed each classification in about 4
seconds.

## Key Contributions

- **VERVE Tool**: We introduce VERVE, which extends our
earlier VISER tool to classify all five types of responsive
layout failures reported by ReDeCheck. VERVE uses two
complementary techniques: manipulating the opacity of HTML
elements and histogram-based image comparison.

- **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation**: We evaluate VERVE
on 45 web pages containing 469 potential RLFs. For element
collision, element protrusion, and viewport protrusion
failures, VERVE's classification agreed with human
classifications up to 91.8% of the time on new subjects not
used during the tool's development.

- **Efficiency**: VERVE took on average about 4 seconds to
classify any individual RLF, making it far faster than the
manual process of opening a browser, resizing the viewport,
scrolling to the failure location, and visually inspecting it.

- **Publicly Available Tool**: VERVE is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/verve-tool/verve), enabling other
researchers and web developers to use it in their own testing
workflows.

## Empirical Results

Our evaluation showed that VERVE performs well across all five RLF types, though
with varying levels of agreement with human classifications. For the original 25
web pages used in the conference version of the paper, VERVE achieved 86.3%
agreement for collision, protrusion, and viewport protrusion failures. For
wrapping failures, the agreement was 78.6%, and for small-range failures it
reached 98.5%. When we tested VERVE on 20 entirely new web pages, it achieved
91.8% agreement for the first three failure types and 73.6% for small-range
failures. Since reviewers sometimes disagree on borderline cases, the results
also demonstrated that VERVE's automated approach can be less subjective than
manual classification, thereby demonstrating the tool's usefulness in practice.

## Future Work

We plan to enhance VERVE's classification accuracy for wrapping failures and to
integrate it more tightly with other responsive web testing tools. Future work
will also explore how VERVE could be combined with our LayoutDR repair tool to
create an end-to-end pipeline that detects, classifies, and fixes responsive
layout failures automatically. As part of future work, we are also investigating
ways to implement VERVE and affiliated tools like ReDeCheck into extensions for
popular browsers like Chrome and Firefox.

streamline your testing process. Since the tool is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/verve-tool/verve), you can also try it! If you
