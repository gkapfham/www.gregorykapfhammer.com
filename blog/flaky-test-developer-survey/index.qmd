## Introduction

As a software developer, you might have encountered the frustrating phenomenon
of flaky tests --- or test cases that pass and fail intermittently without any
changes to the code under test. My colleagues and I recently published
[@Parry2022b] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open
>}}](/research/papers/parry2022b/index.qmd), "Surveying the Developer Experience
of Flaky Tests," that dives into this issue by exploring how real-world software
developers define, experience, and address flaky tests. Keep reading to learn
more about this paper!

## Definitions

Flaky tests often show inconsistent results since they pass or fail seemingly at
random. This inconsistency can severely hinder continuous integration (CI)
processes, decrease productivity, and erode confidence in the testing framework.
Our study confirmed that developers often encounter these troublesome tests, and
that their impacts are widespread and significant.

## Findings

- **The Developer's Perspective on Flaky Tests**: Through a literature-guided
survey distributed across social media and a detailed analysis of 38
StackOverflow threads, we collected responses from 170 developers. This
mixed-method approach helped us understand the common definitions, impacts,
causes, and responses related to flaky tests.

- **Impacts on Continuous Integration and Productivity**: Developers unanimously
agreed that flaky tests disrupt CI processes. Frequent encounters with flaky
tests can lead to ignoring test failures, which might mask genuine issues. Our
respondents highlighted that setup and teardown issues were the most common
causes of flaky tests, often resulting in a loss of valuable development time.

- **Common Causes of Flaky Tests**: The top causes identified include issues in
setup and teardown processes, asynchronous operations, and concurrency problems.
Contrary to some prior studies, we found that asynchronicity and concurrency
were not the top causes, which adds a new dimension to understanding test
flakiness.

- **Strategies for Addressing Flaky Tests**: Developers adopt various strategies
to mitigate flaky tests, from re-running tests and documenting the issues to
quarantining or even deleting problematic tests. Our study provides actionable
recommendations to help developers and researchers tackle flaky tests more
effectively.

### Conclusion

If you've ever been bogged down by the unpredictability of flaky tests, this
paper offers comprehensive insights and practical solutions drawn directly from
the experiences of your peers. Understanding the root causes and common
responses can equip you with the knowledge to improve your testing strategies
and maintain a more reliable CI process.

Our research not only aligns with existing literature but also presents
unexpected findings that challenge previous assumptions about the prevalence and
causes of flaky tests. Whether you're a software developer, tester, or
researcher, the findings and recommendations in this paper will help you enhance
your approach to dealing with flaky tests.
