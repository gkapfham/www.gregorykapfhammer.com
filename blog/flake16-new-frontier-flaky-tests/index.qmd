## Introduction

Isn't it frustrating when you run your test suite and some tests pass and
others fail, even though you haven't changed any code? These tests are often
called flaky tests --- and they present a challenge for software engineers. My
colleagues and I recently published [@Parry2022a] [{{< iconify fa6-solid
book-open>}}](/research/papers/parry2022a/index.qmd)
that introduces FLAKE16, a new feature set that significantly improves the
detection of flaky tests with machine learning. Keep reading to learn more about this paper!

## Results

This paper's study evaluates the performance of 54 machine learning pipelines
for detecting both non-order-dependent (NOD) and order-dependent (OD) flaky
tests. Using real-world Python projects, we found that FLAKE16 outperformed a
well-established feature set in detecting both types of flaky tests.
Specifically, FLAKE16 offered a 13% increase in the overall F1-score when detecting
NOD flaky tests and a 17% increase when detecting OD flaky tests.

One of the key insights from our research is the identification of the most
impactful features for detecting flaky tests. For NOD flaky tests, the peak
number of concurrently running threads during test case execution was the most
impactful. For OD flaky tests, the number of read- and write-related system
calls had the greatest impact.

## Future

Our research is a significant step forward in the field of flaky test
detection. However, we believe there is still much to explore. We plan to
extend our work to include test cases from projects implemented in different
programming languages and evaluate the performance of machine learning models
for detecting flaky tests in additional specific categories.
