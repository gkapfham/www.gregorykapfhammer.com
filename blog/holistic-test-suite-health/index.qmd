<em>Nine indicators reveal whether your test suite
  is truly healthy!</em>

## Introduction

When software developers talk about problematic test suites,
the conversation often begins and ends with flaky tests. And
while flakiness is certainly a serious concern, is it really the
only symptom of an unhealthy test suite? My colleagues and I
argue that it is not. In [@McMinn2025] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open>}}](/research/papers/mcminn2025/index.qmd),
  published
  at the 2nd International Flaky Tests Workshop, we present a
  manifesto that identifies nine distinct indicators of test suite
  health and argues that researchers and practitioners should
  take a holistic view rather than fixating on any single metric.

## Key Contributions

- **Nine Health Indicators**: We identify a checklist of
  indicators that signal an unhealthy test suite, starting with

  flakiness but extending to low code coverage,
  pseudo-testedness, low mutation scores, long-running test
  suites, low test diversity, high brittleness, low realism, and
  high variability of indicator metrics.

- **Trade-offs Between Indicators**: We argue that some
  indicators are complementary while others are in tension. For

  instance, a test suite with fewer assertions may be less flaky
  but also more pseudo-tested, meaning it executes code without
  actually checking it. Pursuing a high mutation score might
  increase brittleness if tests become tightly coupled to
  implementation details rather than intended behavior.

- **A Research Agenda**: We outline seven challenges for the
  research community, ranging from identifying further indicators

  and quantifying trade-offs to building tooling that can give
  developers actionable recommendations for improving the overall
  health of their test suites.

## Empirical Results

  Since this is a short position paper and manifesto, the
  contribution is conceptual rather than experimental. The paper
  synthesizes insights from across the software testing literature
  to make the case that indicators like pseudo-testedness,
  brittleness, and realism deserve the same level of research
  attention that flakiness has received. The accompanying
  [resource page](https://philmcminn.com/test-suite-health)
  catalogs existing detection and improvement tools for each
  indicator, showing where tooling already exists and where gaps
  remain.

## Future Work

  The paper outlines several open challenges, including how to
  measure less well-understood indicators like test realism and
  brittleness, how to combine multiple indicators into a
  composite picture of test suite health, and how to study the
  evolution of test suite health over the lifecycle of a project.
  Ultimately, the goal is to move toward automated tools that not
  only diagnose problems but also recommend concrete actions for
  developers to improve their test suites.
