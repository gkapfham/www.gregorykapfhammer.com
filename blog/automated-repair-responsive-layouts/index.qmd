## Introduction

Have you ever resized your browser window and watched a perfectly designed web
page fall apart? Maybe a logo gets clipped at the edge of the viewport, or two
page elements collide and overlap each other. These are called *responsive
layout failures* (RLFs), and they are surprisingly common on real-world
websites. Fixing them is no simple task either, since it can involve adjusting
dozens of HTML elements and CSS properties across a range of screen sizes. My
colleagues and I tackled this problem by building a tool called LayoutDR ---
short for "Layout Doctor" --- that can automatically detect and repair these
layout failures. In [@Althomali2022] [{{< iconify fa6-solid
book-open>}}](/research/papers/althomali2022/index.qmd), published at the
International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation
(ICST), we present this technique and evaluate it on 19 real-world web pages
containing 55 RLFs. LayoutDR successfully found a fix for every single one, and
when we asked humans to judge the repairs, 92% of participants preferred the
fixed version of the page!

## Key Contributions

- **LayoutDR Technique**: We introduce an approach that
  harnesses the web page's own responsive design to generate
  repairs. When LayoutDR detects an RLF at a certain screen
  width, it looks at the page's layout just outside the failure
  range --- the "bordering layouts" that are free of the problem
  --- and dynamically scales them to cover the broken viewport
  widths, effectively creating a CSS hotfix.

- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: We applied LayoutDR to 19
  web pages from diverse domains, ranging from online language
  learning platforms to browser automation tool sites. The tool
  generated at least one repair for all 55 detected RLFs,
  demonstrating broad applicability across page sizes and
  complexities.

- **Human Study**: We ran a study on Amazon Mechanical
  Turk with 101 participants who compared the original pages
  containing RLFs to the automatically repaired versions. Across
  738 votes, 92% favored a LayoutDR repair over the original
  broken layout. This results suggests that the automated
  fixes are acceptable to real users.

## Empirical Results

This paper revealed several insights about
automated responsive layout repair:

- **The wider bordering layout is more reliable**: LayoutDR
  could always use the layout at the wider side of a failure
  range to generate a repair, while the narrower side was only
  applicable 36% of the time. Participants in the human study
  also generally preferred repairs sourced from the wider
  bordering layout.

- **Repairs are fast**: LayoutDR never took longer than 40
  seconds to generate a repair, even for the most complex web
  page in the study, which had over 1,200 HTML elements. The
  repair time correlated with page complexity, but remained
  practical for real-world use, suggesting that it can be applied
  in a variety of development contexts.

- **Participants overwhelmingly preferred repairs**: For every single RLF in the
human study, votes for the original broken page were never greater than votes
for either of the two repairs. Since this held true even when the repair
contained minor secondary layout issues, there is evidence that people accept
the automated repairs.

## Future Work

We plan to extend LayoutDR in several directions. First, we intend
to improve its detection capability by incorporating visual
verification techniques that can better distinguish genuine
layout failures from false positives. We also aim to develop
methods for repairing overlapping RLFs, where the bordering
layouts themselves contain other failures. Ultimately, the goal
is to create a comprehensive automated solution for
maintaining the visual quality of responsive web pages across
the full range of screen sizes.
