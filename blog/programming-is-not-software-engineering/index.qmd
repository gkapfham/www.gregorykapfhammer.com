<span class="gist">At Allegheny College, a class of students and I are embarking
  on a developer development adventure as we take a hands-on approach to
  learning software engineering.</span> You can participate in our adventure by
reading the collaboratively published content on the [Developer
Development](https://developerdevelopment.com/) web site and joining our
[Developer Development Discord Server](https://discord.gg/aNfn8DNEMx). As part
of the software engineering class the students and I are reading and then
publishing an executive summary about selected articles from the following
online books:

- [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book)
(abbreviated as **SE**): introduces the processes and tools
used by software engineers at Google.
- [Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/) (abbreviated as
**FB**): a savvy, code-focused introduction to the automated tools and
techniques for generating software tests.
- [Debugging Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/) (abbreviated on this site as
**DB**): an interactive introduction to automated methods for debugging and
fixing programs.

The idea is that the **SE** book will help the students and I to learn the
professional skills that we need to develop as developers while the **FB** and
**DB** books will equip us with the technical knowledge skills necessary for
to both understand how software engineering tools and to build our own tools.

In accordance with advice from well-known software engineers like [Addy
Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/), who recently published a blog post entitled
["Write about what you learn. It pushes you to understand topics
better."](https://addyosmani.com/blog/write-learn/), the students and I will be
writing a short précis about each of the articles in the [Developer Development
schedule](https://developerdevelopment.com/schedule/). Today's article, and the
subject of the remainder of this post, is the
[preface](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/pr01.html) of **SE**! This
précis is written from the perspective of an instructor who wants to effectively
teach undergraduates how to engineer software.

Are you interested in following along with the experiences that the students and
I have as we developer as developers in a software engineering course at
Allegheny College? If you are, then I hope that you will check out our
[Developer Development](https://developerdevelopment.com/) that features our
writing and offers status updates about our software engineering experiences and
also join our [Developer Development Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/aNfn8DNEMx). Finally, what do you think are the best
ways to organize effective software engineering education? Please
