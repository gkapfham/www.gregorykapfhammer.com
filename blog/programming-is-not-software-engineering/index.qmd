<span class="gist">At Allegheny College, a class of students and I are embarking
  on a developer development adventure as we take a hands-on approach to
  learning software engineering.</span> You can participate in our adventure by
reading the collaboratively published content on the [Developer
Development](https://developerdevelopment.com/) web site and joining our
[Developer Development Discord Server](https://discord.gg/aNfn8DNEMx). As part
of the software engineering class the students and I are reading and writing
about selected articles from the following online books:

- [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book)
(abbreviated as **SE**): introduces the processes and tools
used by software engineers at Google.
- [Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/) (abbreviated as
**FB**): a savvy, code-focused introduction to the automated tools and
techniques for generating software tests.
- [Debugging Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/) (abbreviated on this site as
**DB**): an interactive introduction to automated methods for finding programmer
errors and their causes.
