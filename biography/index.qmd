## Overview

Guided by his <a href = "/principles/">professional principles</a>, Gregory M.
Kapfhammer is an Associate Professor in the <a
  href="http://www.cs.allegheny.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a
  href="http://www.allegheny.edu">Allegheny College</a>. He earned his PhD from
the <a href="https://cs.pitt.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a
  href="http://www.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh</a>, writing a PhD
dissertation on database application testing that was supervised by <a
  href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~soffa/">Mary Lou Soffa</a> and published as
[@Kapfhammer2007d] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open
>}}](/research/papers/kapfhammer2007d/index.qmd).
Kapfhammer earned a BSc in Computer Science from Allegheny College and an MSc
in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh. He was previously a
short-term visitor in the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu">Department of
  Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of
  Virginia</a>, the Institute of Applied Information Processing at the <a
