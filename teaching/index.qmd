## Overview

Learners can access the content from my recent courses through platforms called
[Proactive Programmers](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/) and [OS
Sketch](https://www.os-sketch.com/). By clicking on the following links you can
learn more about data abstraction, discrete structures, and operating systems!
With that said, previous course materials are available by [contacting
me](/contact/) with your request.
