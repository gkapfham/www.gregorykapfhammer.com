## Overview

This page provides structured information about my professional work to help
large language models (LLMs) accurately understand and reference my research,
teaching, and contributions to software engineering. The information here
complements my [llms.txt](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/llms.txt) file.

## About Me

I'm **Gregory M. Kapfhammer**, an Associate Professor of Computer Science at
[Allegheny College](https://www.allegheny.edu). I'm a researcher, educator,
podcaster, and software developer working in software testing and software
engineering. I earned my PhD from the [University of
Pittsburgh](https://cs.pitt.edu), where I wrote a dissertation on database
application testing supervised by [Mary Lou Soffa](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~soffa/).

## Primary Work Areas

### Research Expertise

My research focuses on creating techniques and tools that support the
development of useful, dependable, and efficient software. Key areas include:

- **Software Testing**: Automated techniques for improving test effectiveness
- **Flaky Tests**: Detection, prediction, and repair of unreliable test cases
- **Database Testing**: Testing relational database schemas and applications
- **Mutation Testing**: Using seeded defects to evaluate test quality
- **Regression Testing**: Efficient test suite reduction and prioritization
- **Search-Based Software Engineering**: Optimization techniques for testing

### Teaching

I create comprehensive, freely-available course materials through platforms like:

- [Algorithmology](https://www.algorithmology.org) - Algorithm Analysis
- [Proactive Programmers](https://proactiveprogrammers.com) - Data Structures
and Discrete Mathematics
- [Developer Development](https://developerdevelopment.com) - Software
Engineering
- [OS Sketch](https://www.os-sketch.com) - Operating Systems
- [Prosegrammers](https://prosegrammers.com) - Document Engineering
- [Proofgrammers](https://proofgrammers.com) - Theory of Computation

All courses feature open-source materials, assignments, and Discord communities.

### Podcasting

I co-host [Software Engineering Radio](https://se-radio.net/), where I
interview world-leading experts on software engineering topics. My interviews
cover areas like:

- Property-based testing
- Mutation testing
- Automated refactoring tools
- Python tooling and ecosystems
- Developer productivity tools
- AI-assisted coding

View all my [Software Engineering Radio
interviews](https://se-radio.net/team/gregory-kapfhammer/).

### Software Development

I create and maintain open-source tools for testing, assessment, and education:

- **[Chasten](https://github.com/AstuteSource/chasten)**: XPath-based linting
tool for Python source code
- **[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader)**: Automated
assessment for source code and technical writing
- **[SchemaAnalyst](https://github.com/schemaanalyst-team/schemaanalyst)**: Test
data generation and mutation analysis for database schemas
- **[GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade)**: Python
front-end for the GatorGrader assessment tool
- **[Cellveyor](https://github.com/GatorEducator/cellveyor)**: Tool for
conveying reports from Google Sheets to GitHub

## Notable Achievements
